### Task:
Generate 1-3 broad tags categorizing the main themes of the chat history, along with 1-3 more specific subtopic tags.

### Guidelines:
- Start with high-level domains (e.g. Science, Technology, Philosophy, Arts, Politics, Business, Health, Sports, Entertainment, Education)
- Consider including relevant subfields/subdomains if they are strongly represented throughout the conversation
- If content is too short (less than 3 messages) or too diverse, use only ["General"]
- Use the chat's primary language; default to English if multilingual
- Prioritize accuracy over specificity

### Output:
JSON format: { "tags": ["tag1", "tag2", "tag3"] }

### Chat History:

# Tag Analysis Result

Based on the chat history analysis:

## Analysis

The conversation consists of only 2 messages:
1. A greeting from the user asking "who are you?"
2. An introductory response from the HELIX system

According to the guidelines:
- Content with less than 3 messages should use only `["General"]`
- The conversation is too short to extract meaningful thematic tags

## Output

```json
{ "tags": ["General"] }
```
